## ** NLP_Spacy **

Goal: Investigate the eBay challenge with the intention of intigrating Machine Learning and AI technics from class. Take advantage of the eBay datasets, learn, build, test, evaluate, and optimize our NLP product.

Plan:

Slicing both datasets for higher effeciency and accuracy

Start google colab for group collaboration

Keep learning and researching on NLP, SpaCy, and similar projects

Use Train Tagged Titles new dataset to build our pipline with custom NERs and patterns

Test the created pipline on a small set of Listing Title dataset

5.1 Loaded the original Training dataset for fuller entity list and better results

Get the Classification report of current model and identify where and what do we need to do to improve the model accuracy (ie. improve the pattern list)

Optimize the model

Optional: explore other libraries ie. sklearn nlp models
